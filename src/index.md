# a study in sage.

_ரசவாதம்_ (rasavādhum), _alchemy_ in Tamil, was an ancient practice, whose most famous goal was to transform lead into gold. Today, we revive a discipline, as close as it gets to _ரசவாதம்_.

Photons travel massive distances, bounce off the world around us, enter a _camera obscura_, and fall on a special paper. A transformation happens. Just like _ரசவாதம்_ intended, a magical transformation is achieved - _film chemistry_. 

Here are the observations of some of my _chemical experiments_.
